# Blazor Movie Application with .NET 8

Welcome to the repository for our Blazor Movie Application, developed live and crafted using the robust .NET 8 framework. This project is a testament to modern web development practices, utilizing Blazor WebAssembly to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience without the necessity for a .NET runtime on the client's machine.

## Key Features

- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Leverages client-side Blazor for a smooth SPA (Single Page Application) experience, reducing server load and enhancing user interaction.
- **C# and Razor Integration**: Employs C# for business logic and Razor syntax for intuitive UI binding, significantly minimizing the reliance on JavaScript.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Implements a modular design using layout components for reusable UI elements like navigation bars and footers, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.
- **Bootstrap and Custom Styling**: Utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and custom CSS for a unique and adaptive user interface, adhering to mobile-first design principles.
- **TMDB API Integration**: Fetches and displays movie data in real-time from The Movie Database (TMDB) API, encapsulated within a service layer for clean and maintainable code.
